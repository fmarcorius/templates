## Patent Policy Option 3:  Open Web Foundation 1.0 Mode.

1.	**Open Web Foundation CLA 1.0 (“OWF CLA 1.0”)**. Each Working Group Participant will be deemed to have executed the 
    OWF CLA 1.0 for its Contributions (as defined in the OWF CLA 1.0) to the Working Group. The OWF CLA 1.0 is available 
    at https://sites.google.com/site/openwebfoundation/legal/the-owf-1-0-agreements/owf-contributor-license-agreement-1-0---copyright-and-patent.  

2.	**Open Web Foundation Approved Deliverable Agreement 1.0 (“OWFa 1.0”)**. Upon a Draft Deliverable being declared an 
    Approved Deliverable, the Working Group chair will request in writing that all Working Group Participants execute 
    the OWFa 1.0 with respect to that Approved Deliverable.  Pursuant to the terms of the OWF CLA 1.0, it is anticipated 
    that the Approved Deliverable will be subject to the OWFa 1.0, but neither this agreement nor the CLA 1.0 imposes a 
    binding legal obligation on any Working Group Participant to execute the OWFa 1.0.  The Open Web Foundation Final 
    Specification Agreement is available at https://sites.google.com/site/openwebfoundation/legal/the-owf-1-0-agreements/owfa-1-0.

3.	**Patent Disclosure**. Any Working Group Participant that does not execute the OWFa 1.0 for the Approved Deliverable 
    within 30 days after the Working Group chair’s written request to do so must disclose, in writing or via e-mail to the 
    chair and all Working Group Participants, whether any of the Working Group Participant’s individual Participants has 
    personal knowledge that a Bound Entity, or any entity it Controls, has patents or published patent applications that 
    contain Granted Claims as defined in the OWFa 1.0.  Patent disclosures must provide the registration or application 
    number/serial number for the applicable patent or published patent application to the Chair. No patent searches are required.
